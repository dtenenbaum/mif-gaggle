The broadcast topic will take messages that come in and send them out to all
connected clients.  

The admin topic will handle administrative functionality, including registering
new clients.  When a new client connects, it will be registered in the
singleton Client Registry class.  This way anything in the Boss VM will be able
to get access to connected clients.
